# Business Central Sales invoice Rapport No. 1306
Business Central Sales Invoice Rapport ID: 1306 with Tariff number added 

To get the tariff I made a copy of report 1306 and made sure it worked properly and called it a new name 50100.
After that I pasted the tariff fields from report 1302 "Pro Forma report" into report 50100

### Here we can see the standard word report without the tariff

After publishing the extension we get the new report, 50100, but with extra fields. Namely tariff and tariffLbl
